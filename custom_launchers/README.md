# Custom Launchers Directory

This directory contains user-customizable launch scripts for projects where the AI detection is uncertain or incorrect.

Each project can have a custom launcher script named after the project (with special characters replaced by underscores).

Example: For a project named 'Stable-Diffusion-WebUI', the custom launcher would be 'Stable_Diffusion_WebUI.sh'

Edit these scripts to customize how each project launches.
